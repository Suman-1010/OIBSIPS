# OIBSIP /UNEMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON

Brief description of my  project.

Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. We have seen a sharp increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so analyzing the unemployment rate can be a good data science project.

 Analyzing unemployment data with Python involves several steps,including
 1.data collection,
 2.data cleaning, 
 3.data exploration, 
 4. datavisualization.
 I'll use Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and NumPy.you can further enhance your analysis by exploring the impact of COVID-19 on unemployment,identifying trends, and conducting statistical tests or machine learning models for prediction or classification tasks related to unemployment.
